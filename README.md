# Law Cases Tracking System
LCTS is a training project created in order to improve programming skills and create something useful.
The main idea is to help Ukrainian attorneys with tracking the appointed court hearings.
Using the open state register LCTS looks for and collects the information about your court cases which are assigned for court proceedings.
Just add the case numbers. LCTS will track them automatically.
